      I have been working on this blog for dayssss…roooh it is taking me so much time. I thought I would quickly make those pages easily, but I am not a coding expert lol. I am looking forward to finish all the HTML stuff so I can post whenever I want.<br>
      I am thinking of having a homepage, a page called « Dumb Thoughts » that will have notes and a page (I haven’t thought about the name yet) that will be a dump of things that I like.<p></p>

      I am in a café with family, I just drank this avocado juice. I was in a really bad mood today but the juice put a smile on my face. Don’t know when I am going to go back home. Don’t know what I will do when I will be home. Need to see friends, take care of my face and body (I look so ugly these days…)
      But what I am sure is that I am so grateful to have escaped from the bad weather of where I live. The sun has been my best friend, my lover. Even though it is windy and a little bit cold, it has been a pleasure to be outside this week. I love this country ! What a blessing to be able to come here since I was born.<p></p>

      Long time no see beautiful princesses !<br>
      (I actually don’t know who I am talking to lol)
      I created this blog so I could post often but I got caught up with a massive amount of work. I feel ashamed, I wanted to be consistent but I failed lol….<p>
      
      I am on holiday with my family and it is so goooood to finally see the sun ! I forgot that the sky is that high and blue (it is December and it’s always raining where I live) 
      I am facing the sun on the terrace, I don’t want to leave this place. Can’t stop debating if I should let the sun rays touch my skin : they can damage it. But is it worth it to live its life away from the sun just to have a beautiful skin? Aging is not ugly, I don’t have any problem with having wrinkles. And if I die old with damaged skin, it would have reflected all the beautiful moments that i spend with people I love on trips.<p></p>
      
      I am hungry, i hope we will eat good food (we will, food is amazing in this country).
      
      I decided to stay under the sun. This weather is too precious to be picky. Almost no clouds, a little bit of fresh wind, I love it!
